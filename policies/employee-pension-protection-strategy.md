 **WHEREAS** 
 

* some employers have failed to fulfill their commitment to Employee Pension Plans, depriving employees of future retirement income in addition to the loss of part or all their current contributions; 

* private pensions should be the responsibility of the commercial enterprises making the commitment, not the taxpayer; 

* the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Actand the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Actprovide “super-priority” to numerous obligations over Employee Pension Plans; 

* the Supreme Court of Canada has favoured the payments of these “super-priority” creditors even at the expense of the original Employee Pension Plan Agreements, giving paramountcy to a flawed insolvency law over any provincial recognition of pension rights; 

* the previous government, recognizing the unjust treatment some Canadians faced with private defined benefit pensions, granted current year pension contributions super-priority status in the Wage Earner Protection Program; 

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urges the Government of Canada to develop and implement an Employee Pension Protection Strategy by: 

* Prioritizing Employee Pension Plans in the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Actand the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Actto recognize super-priority for pension debts

* Reforming current federal legislation with the aim of protecting Employee Pension Plans during insolvency proceedings. 

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada call upon the Government of Canada to consult with stakeholders, organizations, and third parties in its development of the aforementioned strategy.(Ontario)
