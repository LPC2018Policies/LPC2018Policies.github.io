title: "Removing Barriers to Conditional Sentence Orders"
---
      

 **WHEREAS** 
  

* the conditional sentence order (“CSO”), also known as house arrest, was enacted by the Liberal government in 1995 to help correct Canada’s overreliance on incarceration, in particular for Indigenous offenders, as a method to deter crime;

* the amendments to restrict the availability of a CSO, enacted in 2008 and 2012, have contributed to increased litigation, delay and costs in the criminal justice system;

* the amendments to restrict the availability of a CSO disproportionately affects offenders who are vulnerable people in society by forcing the judicial system to impose incarceration on offenders who are young, Indigenous or refugee, and unlikely to reoffend with proper community resources;

* the Canadian taxpayers save approximately $50,000.00 per year for a person serving a CSO as compared to incarceration;

**BE IT RESOLVED**  the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to amend the criminal code to allow greater flexibility to impose conditional sentence orders, in particular for non-violent offences.(Manitoba)
