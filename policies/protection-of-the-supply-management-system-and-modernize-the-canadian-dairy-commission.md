* the Liberal Party of Canada supports the supply management system and its three pillars; production planning based on Canadian consumer demand, negotiated cost of production producer prices, and import controls to effectively adjust supply and demand;

* the Canadian Dairy Commission is a Crown corporation established in 1966 with a mandate to coordinate federal and provincial dairy policies and create a dairy production control mechanism to stabilize revenues and avoid costly surplus production;
