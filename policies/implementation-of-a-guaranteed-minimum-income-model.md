title: "Implementation of a Guaranteed Minimum Income Model"
---
      

 **WHEREAS** 
  

* almost 5 million Canadians live in poverty; 

* the gap between the highest and lowest incomes continues to grow with each passing year;  

* some economists believe that maintaining growth in industrialized countries requires a narrowing of this gap to stimulate household consumption;  

* technological advances, and in particular advances in artificial intelligence, will lead to the loss of many skilled and unskilled jobs; 

* people who lose their jobs will have to retrain, perhaps several times in their lives; 

* a guaranteed minimum income would constitute an unconditional source of income, which could be used by everyone as he or she sees fit;  

* according to some studies, the guaranteed minimum income could replace other provincial and federal government benefitsand would require less administrative work, particularly because of the lack of controls;  

* a pilot project on Guaranteed Minimum Income is currently underway in Ontario and a similar project is being considered in Qu√©bec and other Canadian provinces; 

* the federal government could intervene in this jurisdiction, as it did for universal health insurance;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Government of Canada:

* review past and ongoing pilot projects, as well as studies carried out by academic experts on the subject

* work with the provinces to develop a universal, equitable and sustainable guaranteed minimum income model for the benefit of all Canadians;

* inform and consult with the public on the implementation of this model. (Quebec)
