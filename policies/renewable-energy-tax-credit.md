 **WHEREAS** 
 

* the 30% Investment Tax Credit for solar and other renewable technologies and 2.3 cent per kilowatt hour Production Tax Credit for wind power in consortwith state incentives have spurred a 300 % increase in wind power and 123% increase in the solar industry over the past decade;

* California solar employers overwhelmingly cite the federal tax credits as substantially contributing to their firmsâ€™ success;

* in Canada investment in clean energy investment in 2015 dropped 46%;

* for every million dollars invested in renewable energy 17 jobs are created, compared with 5 for fossil fuel investment;

* Canadian corporations are sitting on an estimated $600 billion in cash (32% of GDP) that could be invested in clean energy, with the right incentives;

* the Americans have proven that major investment in renewable energies encouraged by tax incentives builds the economy and creates jobs without increasing our carbon footprint.

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada strongly encourage the Government of Canada to create a made in Canada Tax Credit Program to drive wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass investment, as well as other renewable energy sources fashioned after the Obama plan of 2015.(Manitoba)
