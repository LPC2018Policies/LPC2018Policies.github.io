 **WHEREAS** 
 

* a modern integrated Canadian energy grid will enable greater energy efficiency, reliability and affordability for Canadians; 

* the creation of a modern Canadian energy grid will be fundamental to supporting Canada’s future clean energy based economy, while also creating immediate jobs needed to complete power-line connections and computerized system upgrades; 

* the International Energy Agency has estimated that Canada’s electricity sector will require $250 billion in new investment by 2030;

* a modern integrated Canadian energy grid will enable fossil fuel dependent provinces to transition toward clean energy as a primary energy source; 

* mass market adoption of electric vehicles is projected within a decade and Canada will require a de-carbonized modern electricity grid to support the transition away from fossil fuel powered vehicles to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change;

* Canada is working closely with European partners to address climate change while modernized energy grids are a proven and fundamental element of the European Union’s energy strategy to reduce costs and meet climate change targets; 

**BE IT RESOLVED**  the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to promote and commit to the creation of a modern integrated Canadian energy grid.(Manitoba)
