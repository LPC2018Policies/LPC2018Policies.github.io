    <h2>Hello (Defenders of the Free & Open) World!</h2>
    <p>This is an unofficial website for the 2018 Liberal Policy Resolutions. It's is unaffiliated with any National Board candidate.</p>
    <p>Please check out and register for the 2018 Liberal National Convention <a href="https://2018.liberal.ca/">here</a></p>
    <p>All of these policies are extracted from the original document <a href="https://2018.liberal.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/1650/2018/03/2018_Liberal_Policy_Resolutions.pdf">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>I worked on this because I'd like the party to be mindful of how PDFs are not so great, especially for mobile users.</p>
    <p>It's hosted for free on Github and constructed using Gatsby!</p>
    <p>The design is barebones and ugly right now. I'll pretty it up over the next few days.</p>
    <p>Cheers, <br/> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sushil-tailor-48a36918">Sushil Tailor</a></p>
