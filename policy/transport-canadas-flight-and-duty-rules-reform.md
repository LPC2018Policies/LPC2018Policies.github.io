title: "Transport Canada’s “Flight and Duty Rules” Reform"
---
      

 **WHEREAS** 
 

* Transport Canada is pursuing changes to the Flight and Duty Rules that apply to many northern and remote air operators in Canada, said rules having been published July 1 in the Canada Gazette; 

* analysis by the Northern Air Transport Association (NATA) has revealed that many of the changes will have an adverse effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of northern operators who provide critical medevac services;

* there is no evidence to suggest that there has been deterioration in safety in medivac services throughout the north due to incidences of fatigue; 

* the revised rules actually decrease safety for those flying medivac services throughout northern and remote areas given that time behind the controls and frequency of experience flying into challenging air strips will be decreased for pilots;

* management of health and welfare of Canadians living in the north and remote areas is complex with this complexity also experienced in the transportation of the medically challenged to appropriate medical facilities;

* a common element associated with all medical lift actions is the unpredictability of the mission and thus the importance of relying on good judgment by operators with experience and commitment to maintaining the highest possible operational standards; 

* thenew rules appear to be focused on circumstances faced in southern Canada, with no understanding of the unique issues associated with northern and remote aviation.  

**BE IT RESOLVED** : 

* Transport Canada postpone the Gazette process regarding new rules until acomprehensive system safety review is conducted to determine whether current regulations result in scenarios where safety is compromised due to pilot fatigue;

* assuming the outcome of the system safety review is negative, that Transport Canada officials hold a dialogue with northern operators to determine ways to strengthen safety through regulation or adoption and communication of best practices that are unique to northern and remote circumstances;

* Transport Canada inventory the current state of flight infrastructure associated with safe flying in northern and remote environments (approach aids, landing lights and runways of sufficient length), with an eye to setting priorities for infrastructure upgrade or installation funding, as this is a far greater impediment to safe flying in northern areas of Canada;

* Transport Canada pursue the recommendations of the Office of the Auditor General’s 2017, Report 6 regarding establishment of essential airports and definition of “Northern Canada”, matters directly related to safe air transportation throughout Canada’s north.  (Yukon)
