 **WHEREAS** 
 

* 246,000 seniors were living in poverty in Canada in 2015 (below the low-income cut-off after tax (LICO));

* 78 % of those living in poverty are single and 69% of these most vulnerable single seniors are women;

* seniors may face a sudden change in their financial circumstances, due to illness, reduced pension due to spousal death, or the need to carry two housing costs as a result of split residence requirements due to a serious illness of their spouse;

* senior women are more likely to experience a worsening of their financial condition due to a spousal death, as the husband has traditionally been the major family income earner and pensions typically reduce to 60% survivor benefit;

* seniors on OAS and GIS are already the most financially vulnerable;

* a claw back is applied to OAS and GIS when additional income is realized. Subsidized housing is also affected when additional income is realized;

* additional income could be needed for necessary home modification, medical procedureor support program, funeral costs, double housing needs, etc. 

**BE IT RESOLVED** : 

* the Government allows seniors more flexibility to make additional income, without triggering a claw back in their OAS and GIS;

* a sliding scale could be utilized where a percentage is clawed back that increases at certain levels of additional income and is zero below a certain threshold;

* it can also be available only for a limited number of years so as not to trigger an unfair situation with other seniors that have the same income, however may not be getting the same GIS and OAS benefits.(National Caucus)
