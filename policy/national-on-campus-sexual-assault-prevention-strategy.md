 **WHEREAS** 
 

* In 2016 Canadian universities reported that less than 10% of sexual assault complaints were followed by a formal investigation;

* There is not a national standard on sexual assault policy on post-secondary campuses in Canada, causing many victims of sexual violence at post-secondary institutions to internalize their trauma or leave the institution;

* Only three provinces have mandated sexual violence on campus policies, leaving young Canadiansin other provinces vulnerable;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Canadian government create a National On-Campus Sexual Assault Strategy to reduce the percentage of acts of sexual violence on post-secondary campuses, to create a mandatory formal procedure for post-secondary administrations to follow after the initial report of sexual violence, and to work towards ensuring a safe climate for Canadians to earn their education in.(Youth Commission)
