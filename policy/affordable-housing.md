 **WHEREAS** 
  

* residents in Canada have the right to affordable housing, regardless of ethnicity, cultural background, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, or disability; 

* students, women, and Indigenous people face particular challenges in finding clean, safe and affordable housing;

* there is an acute shortage of affordable public and non-market housing for those of lower income;  

* those of lower income fear housing security is not reliable or robust enough to meet current needs;  

* many housing complexes were constructed without fully accessible suites;  

* the building and development industry does not design or engineer residential housing for ready conversion for accessibility inside and outside the residence; 

* the present federal government has shown great leadership in developing a national housing strategy; 

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to: 

* institute a funding program to modify existing non-market housing complexes to meet current health, safety, and accessibility codes

* support the principle that the total cost of public non-market housing for lower income residents of Canada should not exceed 30% of their gross annual income.   (Alberta)
