* other studies, such as Dietz and O’Neil’s hypothesis contained in “Enough is Enough-Building a Sustainable Economy in a World of Finite Resources”, suggest that a largerproportion of the global population could achieve a middle-class lifestyle with a reducedimpact on the environment;

**BE IT RESOLVED** that the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada:

* to accept that it must provide active leadership to set and achieve goals for long termenvironmental sustainability, including air, water, land, habitat, and speciesdiversification in addition to climate change;
