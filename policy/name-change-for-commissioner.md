title: "Name Change for “Commissioner”"
---
      

 **WHEREAS** 
  

* the title of “Commissioner” has been commonly (though not exclusively)used by Canada for the Chief Executive Officers of the territorial governments (the role that in the Provinces today is called the “Lieutenant Governor”);

* in the early days of territories in Canada, between 1869 and 1905, the title “Lieutenant Governor” was used for the Chief Executive Officer of Rupert’s Land and North-Western Territory (1869-1870), Manitoba and the North-West Territories (1870-1876) and the North-West Territories (1876-1905);

* the political evolution of territories has been consistent with the evolution of Provinces in the federation;

* the territories have mature governments with “administration and control” of the same areas of jurisdiction normally associated with Provinces in Canada (Nunavut is actively working on transfer of lands and resources which have been finished in Yukon and the Northwest Territories);

* the Commissioners have, since the 1980s, been accepted in the “Vice-Regal Club” of the Governor General and Provincial Lieutenant Governors; 

* the role of Commissioner is officially described in the Government of Canada publication Commissioners of the Territories(Ottawa, 2000) as “…the commissioner’s role has become more like that of a lieutenant governor of a province”;

* the Commissioners, because of the title, are often confused with the many other Officers of government with “Commissioner” in the title (e.g. Commissioner of Official Languages; Information Commissioner of Canada; Commissioner of Environment and Sustainable Development etc.); 

**BE IT RESOLVED** :

* Canada change the title of “Commissioner” to “Territorial Lieutenant Governor” which more appropriately reflects the nature of the Office and the maturity of the territories in the Canadian federation; 

* this change in title takes place as soon as possible through Prime Ministerial recognition as a working title in advance of legislation that will recognize this name change through amendments to the territorial constitutions: Yukon Act, Northwest Territories Act and Nunavut Act.  (Yukon)
