 **WHEREAS** 
  

* the oil and gas sector is a key industry for Canada and an integral part of national economic growth and job creation; 

* interprovincial pipeline construction presents an opportunity for nation-building and Canadian infrastructure development;

* Canadian oil and gas independence would allow Canada to ensure that domestic natural resource extraction and usage would be carried out more efficiently, safely, and sustainably than in countries which export oil and gas to Canada; 

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the government to: 

* implement a strategy for oil and gas independence, with particular attention to:ostrong environmental and safety regulations, and oversight of the oil and gas sectoronational job creation and economic growth; and orespect for the rights and interests of Indigenous Peoples
