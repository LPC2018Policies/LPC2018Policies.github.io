 **WHEREAS** 
 

* Canadian society is aging rapidly and seniors make up almost 16% of our population; this number is expected to grow to 24% by 2030; 

* this trend will have a profound impact on our health care system, social services, and the economy;

* seniors are a diverse group of individuals with a wide range of capabilities, needs, vulnerabilities and resources; 

* seniors, like other Canadians, deserve the highest possible quality of life and personal dignity;

* seniors' issues are currently shared between a number of ministers and government departments, committees, and agencies; 

* this fragmentation means that seniors do not have a dedicated voice to represent their rights and interests; 

* the amalgamation of responsibility for seniors under one dedicated minister would result in a clear vision and coordinated approach to seniors' needs, systemic and cost efficiencies, and consistency in program development and implementation across the country; 

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada strongly urge the Government of Canada to establish a dedicated Ministryof Seniors, with a mandate to: 

* consult and engage with Canada's seniors; 

* protect and vigorously promote the needs and interests of seniors as well as the value of seniors to civil society; 

* establish a national seniors strategy that defines common goals and standards from coast to coast to coast; 

* liaise with provincial, territorial, municipal, and Indigenous counterparts on areas of mutual concern or overlapping jurisdiction including but not limited to health care, housing, income security, home care, long term care, pharmacare, social isolation, elder abuse, and ageism; and

* develop national standards and monitoring protocols for seniors' programs.(Alberta)
