title: "Implementing Universal Access to Necessary Medicines"
---
      

 **WHEREAS** 
 

* the United Nations and the World Health Organization have declared that all nations should ensure universal access to necessary medicines and Canada does not;

* drug coverage is a fundamental component of receiving proper medical treatment and individuals should have access regardless of financial ability;

* Canada’s public and private drug plans leave many patients with little or no coverage, resulting in 1 out of 10 patients not taking their prescribed medication;

* a moderate increase in public spending would reduce the burden on employers, unions, and private insurers;

* a recent report from the Parliamentary Budget Office, estimates that Pharmacare would save Canadians between $4 billion and $11 billion per year;

* there have been repeated calls to include prescription drugs in Canada’s universal health care system, including:

* Royal Commission on Health Services (1964, chair Justice Emmett Hall)

* National Forum on Health (1997, chair Prime Minister Jean Chrétien),

* Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada (2002, chair Roy Romanow),

* Citizens Reference Panel on Pharmacare (2016, chair Peter MacLeod),

* Several national organisations including Canadian Nurses Association, Canadian Medical Association, Federation of Canadian Municipalities

* “Pharmacare 2020: The future of drug coverage in Canada” (UBC 2015)

* the Liberal Party of Canada adopted a priority resolution at the 2016 National Convention to implement a National Pharmacare plan before 2019;

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to:

* amend theCanada Health Actby adding, ‘prescription medicines prescribed by a licensed practitioner in accordance with an established formulary’ to the definition of covered services;

* develop, with provincial and territorial cooperation, a universal, single-payer, evidence-based, and sustainable public drug plan, with purchasing power to secure best available pricing, beginning with a list of essential medicines addressing priority health needs and expanding to a comprehensive permanent plan to promote the health and well-being of all Canadians.This Policy Resolution was co-sponsored by the Liberal National Caucus, LPC (BC) and LPC(O).
