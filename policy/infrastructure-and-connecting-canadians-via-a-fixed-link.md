 **WHEREAS** 
  

* the Island of Newfoundland depends on ferry service for access to goods and services and travel for visitors to or from the Island;

* weather and ice can lead and has led to significant delays;

* mechanical problems with aging ferryfleets can lead and has led to significant delay;

* such delays cause expensive disruptions to businesses, communities, individuals, and governments; and can increase the cost of goods, including food;

* Prince Edward Island was connected to mainland Canada two decades ago;

* technology has advanced significantly, as evidenced by recent construction of long-distance subsea tunnels in Norway;

* providing a fixed link between the Island of Newfoundland would better connect the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and all Canadians;

* construction of such a project would be a major economic stimulus;

* such a link would provide ongoing benefits to NL and other provinces along the transit route (e.g., Quebec) from more reliable transportation alternatives and the potential for increased tourism

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada call on the Government of Canada to: 

* fully document the feasibility of such a fixed link, including the attendant economic benefits arising therefrom to the province, the region, and the country, and seek proposals for construction of a fixed link;

* consider all possible funding options, including public-private partnerships, tolls, and direct funding, to achieve this goal(Newfoundland and Labrador)
