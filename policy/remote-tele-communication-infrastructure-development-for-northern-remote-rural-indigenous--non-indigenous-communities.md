 **WHEREAS** 
 

* the internet offers huge opportunities for Indigenous peoples to participate in the world economy through telecommunications, and online marketing;

* the internet can also be used by Indigenous peoples to strengthen their communities;

* Food in security is a serious problem in northern and remote Indigenous communities across the territory shared with Canada and there exists a strong body of research and traditional knowledge with respect to food security and northern Indigenous health which would be easily accessible through the internet. 

**BE IT RESOLVED** the Liberal Party of Canada urge the Government of Canada to:

* partner with Provinces, Indigenous communities and Organizations, as well as Tech and Infrastructure providers, to develop enhanced telecommunications options for First Nation, Metis, and Inuit communities;

* commit to bringing forth access high-speed internet by 2025 to not only rural and remote communities across Canada but also to First Nation, Metis, and Inuit communities in which Canada shares territory with;

* partner with Provincial governments & Indigenous governments to enhance distance learning education, and its delivery, to support Indigenous economic growth and learning.(IndigenousPeoplesâ€™Commission)
